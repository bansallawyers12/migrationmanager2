## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viplucmca/migrationmanager.git
   cd migrationmanager
   # Or if using migrationmanager2:
   # cd migrationmanager2
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment setup**
   ```powershell
   copy .env.example .env   # If the repo has no .env.example, create .env manually
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
   - Optional: add **CRM access** variables (see [Configuration](#configuration) → CRM cross-access) for strict allocation, approvers, and grant TTLs.

5. **Database setup**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Update `.env` file with your database credentials:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=migration_manager
   DB_USERNAME=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```
   - Ensure PHP has the `pdo_pgsql` extension enabled (e.g. `php -m` and confirm `pdo_pgsql` is listed, or enable it in `php.ini`)
   - Run migrations and seeders:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

6. **Storage setup**
   ```bash
   php artisan storage:link
   ```
   - Create necessary directories (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path storage/app/public/agreements, storage/app/public/checklists, storage/app/public/attachments
   ```

7. **Configure mail settings**
   Update `.env` with SendGrid and sender details:
   ```env
   MAIL_MAILER=sendgrid
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_sender@yourdomain.com
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="Your Company Name"
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_sender@yourdomain.com
   SENDGRID_BASE_URL=https://api.sendgrid.com
   ```

8. **Build frontend assets**
   ```bash
   npm run copy:flatpickr   # Copies Flatpickr assets to public/ (required for date pickers)
   npm run build
   # Or for development:
   npm run dev
   ```

9. **Install Python dependencies** (optional, for DOCX to PDF document conversion)
   - If using document conversion, run from project root:
   ```bash
   cd python_services && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - LibreOffice may be required for high-quality DOCX conversion

10. **Configure payment gateways** (Optional)
    Add to `.env`:
    ```env
    STRIPE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
    STRIPE_SECRET=your_stripe_secret_key
    
    PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY=your_payu_merchant_key
    PAYU_SALT=your_payu_salt
    ```

11. **Start the application**
    - If using XAMPP:
      - Point your virtual host to the `public` directory
      - Or access via `http://localhost/migrationmanager2/public` (adjust path if your folder name differs)
    
    - Using PHP's built-in server:
      ```bash
      php artisan serve
      ```
    
    - For queue workers (run in separate terminal):
      ```bash
      php artisan queue:work
      ```

## Development

### Running the application

For development with XAMPP:
1. Start Apache from XAMPP Control Panel; ensure PostgreSQL is running (install separately if needed)
2. Access the application at `http://localhost/migrationmanager2/public` (or `http://migrationmanager.local` if virtual host is configured)

For development with PHP built-in server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

Access at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Background Jobs

Start the queue worker for processing background jobs:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

### Default Login Credentials

After running migrations with seed, use these credentials:

**Admin:**
- Email: admin@admin.com
- Password: (check `database/seeders/AdminUserSeeder.php`)

### Virtual Host Setup (XAMPP)

Add to `C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf`:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/migrationmanager2/public"
    ServerName migrationmanager.local
    <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/migrationmanager2/public">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Add to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1 migrationmanager.local
```

## Key Modules

### Admin Module
- Dashboard with key metrics
- Complete client management
- Matter/case tracking (visa applications)
- Invoice and payment management
- Staff and team management
- System settings and configuration

### Client Portal

### Storage Structure

The application organizes files in the following structure:

```
storage/app/public/
├── agreements/           # Client service agreements
├── checklists/          # Document checklists
├── attachments/         # Email and document attachments
└── documents/           # Client uploaded documents

public/
├── assets/              # UI assets and images
├── css/                 # Custom stylesheets (includes flatpickr.min.css)
├── js/                  # JavaScript files (flatpickr.min.js, crm-flatpickr.js, scripts.js)
└── img/                 # Public images
```

### Date Picker (Flatpickr)

The CRM uses **Flatpickr** for all date inputs (replacing Bootstrap Datepicker/daterangepicker). A global `CRM_Flatpickr` helper provides:

- **initStandard** - Single date picker (DD/MM/YYYY)
- **initPastDates** - Past-dates-only (max: today) for DOB, address dates, visa dates
- **initDOB** - Date of birth with automatic age calculation
- **initDateTime** - Date + time for appointments
- **initRange** - Date range for report filters

Use `data-flatpickr="standard"`, `data-flatpickr="dob"`, `data-flatpickr="datetime"`, or `data-flatpickr="range"` for auto-initialization. Run `npm run copy:flatpickr` after `npm install` to copy Flatpickr assets to `public/`.

### Background Jobs & Scheduling

- Use Laravel's scheduler for automated tasks:
  - **`access:expire-grants`** (hourly) — marks time-expired active grants and very old pending supervisor requests as expired (`CrmAccessService::expireStaleGrants`)
  - Appointment reminders
  - Visa expiry notifications
  - Follow-up reminders
  - Invoice payment reminders
- Queue workers handle:
  - Email sending
  - Document processing
  - PDF generation
  - Report generation

### Document Conversion

The system includes Python-based document conversion via `python_services/`:

- **Purpose**: Convert DOCX documents to PDF format
- **Usage**: `PythonConverterService` (PHP) calls the Python API; set `PYTHON_CONVERTER_URL` in `.env` (default: `http://localhost:5000`)
- **Setup**: Run `python_services/start_services.py` or equivalent to start the conversion API
- **Integration**: Documents uploaded as DOCX are converted via the API; conversion can run in background queue

CRM_ACCESS_EXEMPT_ROLE_IDS=1,17

# Comma-separated staff.id values that bypass allocation like exempt roles (default: 36718)
CRM_ACCESS_EXEMPT_STAFF_IDS=36718

# Comma-separated staff.id values who may approve supervisor requests (plus all active role-1 staff)
CRM_ACCESS_APPROVER_STAFF_IDS=36834,36524,36692,36483,36484,36718,36523,36836,36830

# Roles that may only use quick access, not supervisor path (default: 14 — Calling Team)
CRM_ACCESS_QUICK_ONLY_ROLE_IDS=14

# When true, non-exempt staff only see allocated clients/leads (+ active grants)
CRM_ACCESS_STRICT_ALLOCATION=false

# Grant durations and caps
CRM_ACCESS_QUICK_GRANT_MINUTES=15
CRM_ACCESS_SUPERVISOR_GRANT_HOURS=24
CRM_ACCESS_MAX_PENDING_SUPERVISOR_REQUESTS=5
CRM_ACCESS_PENDING_TTL_DAYS=14
```

For detailed Company Employer Sponsorship implementation notes, see `docs/COMPANY_EMPLOYER_SPONSORSHIP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

For cross-access product rules, routes, and rollout status, see **`docs/CROSS_ACCESS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**.

## Important Notes

- The application is optimized to work with XAMPP (Apache) on Windows; PostgreSQL must be installed separately
- Run `npm run copy:flatpickr` after `npm install` so date pickers work correctly
- Python API service (`python_services/`) handles DOCX to PDF conversion; optional if not using DOCX uploads
- PostgreSQL is the primary database; ensure `pdo_pgsql` PHP extension is enabled
- The application uses Laravel's built-in authentication with multi-role support
- Document storage is handled locally by default, with optional S3 integration
- Comprehensive logging is available in `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Email integration supports both SMTP and IMAP protocols
- Payment gateways (Stripe, PayU) need to be configured for online payments
- SMS providers (Twilio, Cellcast) need to be configured for SMS notifications
- Client portal provides secure access for clients to track their applications
- **CRM cross-access**: ensure `php artisan schedule:run` (or cron) runs in production so `access:expire-grants` executes; set `CRM_ACCESS_STRICT_ALLOCATION=true` only after UAT (see implementation plan)

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
- **Connection refused**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running (XAMPP does not include PostgreSQL; install separately)
- **pdo_pgsql not loaded**: Enable the `pdo_pgsql` extension in `php.ini`; run `php -m` and confirm `pdo_pgsql` appears in the list
- **Access denied**: Verify database credentials in `.env` file
- **Table not found**: Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to create tables

### PDF / DOCX Conversion Issues
- **DOCX conversion fails**: Ensure the Python conversion service is running (`python_services/`); set `PYTHON_CONVERTER_URL` in `.env` if not using default `http://localhost:5000`
- **Permission denied**: Check storage folder permissions (775 or 777)

### Email Issues
- **Emails not sending**: Verify MAIL_* configuration in `.env`
- **SMTP authentication failed**: Use app-specific passwords for Gmail
- **Emails going to spam**: Configure SPF and DKIM records for your domain

### Date Picker (Flatpickr) Issues
- **Date pickers not appearing**: Run `npm run copy:flatpickr` to copy Flatpickr assets to `public/js/` and `public/css/`
- **"flatpickr is not defined"**: Ensure `flatpickr-assets` and `flatpickr-scripts` components are included in the layout (see `layouts/crm_client_detail.blade.php`)

### Performance Issues
- **Slow page loads**: Run `php artisan optimize` and `npm run build`
- **Queue not processing**: Ensure `php artisan queue:work` is running
- **High memory usage**: Increase PHP memory_limit in php.ini

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit `.env` file** - Contains sensitive credentials
- **Use strong passwords** - Enforce password policies for users
- **Enable HTTPS** - Use SSL certificates in production
- **Regular backups** - Automated daily database backups recommended
- **Update dependencies** - Run `composer update` and `npm update` regularly
- **Role-based access** - Limit admin access to trusted staff only
- **Two-factor authentication** - Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts
- **Data encryption** - Sensitive client data should be encrypted at rest

## Backup & Data Management

### What to Backup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database dumps (daily recommended)
- **Storage folder**: `storage/app/public/` containing:
  - Client documents
  - Agreements
  - Attachments
  - Generated PDFs
- **Environment file**: `.env` (store securely, not in repository)
- **Uploaded files**: All content in `public/` except framework files

### Backup Commands
```powershell
# PostgreSQL database backup (PowerShell)
$date = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd"
pg_dump -U postgres migration_manager | Out-File "backup_$date.sql"

# Storage backup (use robocopy or 7-Zip on Windows)
robocopy storage\app\public "backup_storage_$date" /E
```

### Data Retention
- Keep client records for minimum 7 years (immigration regulations)
- Archive old matters after case closure
- Regularly clean up old logs and temporary files

## FAQ

**Q: Nothing appears after login**
- Ensure migrations have been run: `php artisan migrate --seed`
