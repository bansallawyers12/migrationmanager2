  Engagement icons: only spam-report is shown.
  Open and click tracking are disabled for deliverability — open pixels are pre-fetched by
  Gmail and Apple Mail making data unreliable, and click-tracking rewrites links through
  SendGrid's shared domain which can harm spam scores and break signed/portal links.
  Delivery status (delivered, bounced, etc.) is tracked reliably via SMTP delivery events.
